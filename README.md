project name: Masterblog API

This project demonstrates how to build an API while using Flask. 
It simulates a server (backend) and a web-application(frontend).
There also is a simple API-documentation created via flask_swagger_ui 
which you can reach by using: http://localhost:5002/api/docs  

Be aware of starting both files backend_app.py and/or frontend_app.py depending on use/test.

To ensure the program to run you have to import/install the mentioned requirements of the requirements.txt.
